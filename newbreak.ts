    Finally we arrive at the core of the algorithm. The basic principle is
    actually quite simple: find the optimum solution (minimize the number
    of demerits) given all the possible, feasible breakpoints in a paragraph.
    You do this by walking the tree of all possible breakpoints. Tree
    search algorithms are recursive algorithms. Here's another way to
    say it: To find the best way to break a paragraph,

    * Find the possible breakpoints for line one.
    * For each possible line-one breakpoint, find the best way to
      break the rest of the paragraph.
    * Compare the solutions and return the best one.

    This leads itself very naturally to a recursive implementation.

    The reason this is so complicated in the case of TeX is that Knuth was
    a great programmer trying to write a really neat algorithm that would
    run quickly on a small computer with little memory. So he had to do all
    kinds of clever linear programming to run in the optimum time and memory.
    I am not a great programmer and I don't give a damn. I'm quite happy to
    use the recursive implementation, trading off time and memory for
    simplicity.
